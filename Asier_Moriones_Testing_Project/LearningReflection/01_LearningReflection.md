> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was easy for me to manage GitLab, because it's really similar to GitHub, which is one of the apps I use the most in my daily work. I could say it was familiar to me to use this Webapp.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I took each test case one by one and started testing all the positive scenarios, ensuring there were no errors and that the tests passed successfully. Then, I proceeded with the negative tests, attempting to trigger all potential errors the web application should throw for each input field and selection. Additionally, I tried repeating the names of the projects, issues, and all tested areas to observe the web application's response and noted it in the test cases.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -I really don't know any other tools for test case management, but I know the NetBeans IDE has some section for this type of things. Anyways, I don't know how it works because I never used it.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I normally use Visual Code, cause I think it has everything I need for my works, it's a real complete IDE. When I was younger I also used Kate or the notepad.
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-I didn't find any troubles, everything was clearly explained


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn't find any troubles, I'm used to use this kind of apps in my home university for every subject.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I've heard that test cases are really easy to do in Java, so I have enough time I will try to learn how they work and try to use them with the NetBeans IDE. 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Java, Cucumber, Selenium, Quality Assurance, Software Testing



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Test Case Design, Test Automation, Java, API Testing, Test Management Tools, and obviously group communication




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- It was a good way to start playing with test cases, using a really known Webapp, and fighting with a bug that was really easy to understand.
Concerning the project, it proved to be both beneficial and enjoyable. It allowed us to apply the theoretical knowledge gained during the course into practical situations.
